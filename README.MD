# Spice Girls API
This is an API running on express and mongoDB.
The project is currently hosted on Render at https://sg-api-zr1g.onrender.com (This may change in the future)


## Docsify Info here
- [Spice Girls API Documentation](https://evilgenius13.github.io/spicegirls-api-docsify/#/)
- A full guide to the API can be found in the documentation above.

## Tests
- Tests are run with Mocha and Chai
- Due to the nature of the test suites, the tests need to be done in a specific order.
- 'npm test:serial' will run the tests in the correct order.

# TODO

- switch to replicaset
